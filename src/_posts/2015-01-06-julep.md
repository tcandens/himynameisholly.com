description: "I created several sets of banner advertisements in collaboration with the marketing department at Julep, a growing nail polish brand. Rather than using the normal images of hands and nails, photographs of different types of woman were used to target the demographics of specific sites, such as theknot.com, match.com, pandora.com and yogajournal.com."
