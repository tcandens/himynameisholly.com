description: "Dainty Obsessions is a bridal magazine that offers “Inspiration for the Midwestern Bride” serving South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa,  and Nebraska with inspiring vendors, real weddings, and advice from brides in the region. I was brought in to design stationery for a “boho in the woods” themed styled shoot. Using watercolors and delicate illustrations, I incorporated elements that were going to be used on the shoot as well as colors that create a friendly yet elegant invitation. Included in the invitation are wild flower seed confetti hearts, which friends can plant in anticipation of the beautiful ceremony in the woods."
