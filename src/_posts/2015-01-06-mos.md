description: "Mo's Espresso is a small coffee shop located inside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Seattle. I worked closely with the owner, Jennifer Momyer to created a fun and personal brand. We were inspired by her love of vintage typography, the base itself, and her adorable Corgi-Australian Shepard mix named Rosie Blue.</p><p>Updates are coming soon as I am also working on web presence for Mo's."
