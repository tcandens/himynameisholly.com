description: "Square Tomato is a small but potent advertising agency located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle, WA. With a small dedicated team and a creative environment, they’re able to deliver thoughtful and unique advertising to their clients. As an intern at Square Tomato in 2011, I was told to take a shot at redesigning their social media platforms. To encourage fans of the agency to interact with and get to know the agency itself, I created a mascot known simply as, The Tomato. He embodies the different personalities of everyone in the agency and is also completely customizable so that the staff will be encouraged to play. I created a Facebook page as well as a blog. Not to mention making Tom, the 12x12” plush tomato."
