description: "Brandon and Alyssa are a young couple from Sioux Falls, South Dakota that invited me to brand their special day with modern designs and an air of traditional sophistication. Partnering with Joey Thies, we also created a responsive website to complement the invitation suite and to serve as a tool for guests and members of the wedding party."
